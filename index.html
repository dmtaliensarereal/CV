                    Hi, my name is Pavel, I am a 20 year old student of Minsk State Linguistic University with a big interest in photography, cinematography, literature and adventures.
                    <br>
                    I am currently working as a Technical Support Representatve and have an interest in the field of programming.
                    <br>
                    I am always eager to expand my knowledge and try something new as it helps me to grow as a person and as a peofessional as well, therefore I am always up to take any oportunities.
                    <br>
                    For the time being, I am studying HTML, CSS and Java Script. I also fancy iOS Development and QA Automation.
                    <br>
                    Experience and knowledge are the greatest assets, so I am always open to consider any offers and internships.
